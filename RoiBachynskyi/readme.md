- Moved to the lab computer and installed Ubuntu
- Installed i3 window manager to start learnign no-mouse way of using the computer and OS
- Chose my [first issue](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=116432064&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Cembassy%7C4)
- Flashed the NXP board

## 1 July 2025
- Tried to flash the examples for the NXP Board: `blinky_nop` worked as intended, `button_executor` didn't print anything
- Spent 1 hour trying to understand what is wrong in the second example
- Explored `pint.rs` and `gpio.rs` files
- Thanks to George, the problem was found: allegedly, the asyncronous program didn't work because of the secure and non-secure mode. The only thing that could fix it is 1) flashing 2) `probe-rs attach` 3) pressing the reset button
- Explored the `fmt` module in `embassy-rp` which was used in `embassy-nxp`
- Not finished writing the code for features because of feature propagation 

## 2 July 2025
- Read a half of the book about macros ([link](https://lukaswirth.dev/tlborm/introduction.html)) to understand what happens in `fmt.rs`
- Thanks to George, understood the logic behind `defmt` and `log`
- Implemented `log-to-defmt` feature
- Closed my first issue

## 3 July 2025
- Chose my new [issue](https://github.com/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/embassy/issues/3) 
- Read a chapter about USART to understand how it works on this board
- Made some changes in the pull request as George asked me
- Started reading `embassy-rp` implementation of UART

## 4 July 2025
- Found a [pinout](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/en/pins) for LPC55S69 board (the datasheet is indeed awful)
- Wrote down pins for UART for each Flexcomm
- Found an instruction how to work with USART on LPC55S69 (planning to work on the implementation during the weekend)
- Explored `lpc55-pac`  

## 5-17 July 2025
- On vacation with my family

## 18 July 2025
- Fixed last problems in my ```log-to-defmt``` issue, rebased the changes from ```embassy``` GitHub repository and started my first [PR](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/pull/4416)
- Started to implement USART following the documentation advice (got a bit complicated)

## 21 July 2025
- Dirbaio asked to remake the commit
- The initial guess was the correct one, therefore I read `fmt.rs` in `embassy-rp` several times once again, I added one more macro (`unimplemented!()`) that wasn't introduced in `embassy-rp`
- Dirbaio approved my PR, yay!

## 22 July 2025
- Started to work on USART once again
- Implemented writing to TX and reading from RX in loopback mode
- Tried to figure out why it didn't work physically, but failed, continue tomorrow 

## 23 July 2025
- Tried to debug my USART code and see what is wrong
- Currently, it's failing to work in normal mode (instead of loopback mode), something is blocking the signal
- Tried to debug it using Arduino Uno as a slave, but it didn't work out. Then, I thought the problem was in USART connection with the computer, but sadly, not.
- Denis told me to look at `lpc-hal`, George suggesed looking at C-implementation
- Helped Irina with her `nxp-pac` and `chiptool` (unfortunately, it doesn't have any documentation)

## 24 July 2025
- Finally, I fixed my USART so that I can transmit bits using wires, not loopback mode. Thanks to Alex!
- The problem was in `IOCON` register, it lacked full configuration
- Left earlier because I had an appointment to a dentist

## 25 July 2025
- Read `embassy-rp`'s implementation of USART to understand the ownership rules and how to write driver implementation
- Tried to help Denis with his SPI, but there's still something we both don't see
- For the whole period I had problems with flashing of the NXP board: every time I restarted it, `probe-rs` didn't flash the board. Them problem was fixed by someone, but the change has not been used by the main branch
- Implemented baudrate configuration for USART

## 28 July 2025
- Wrote all the blocking functions for USART, so that an array of bytes can be either read or written.
- Had problems with reading, but it was so simple: `fifordnopop` should have been used to check the FIFO state instead of `fiford`, every reading of `fiford` register entails data loss

## 29 July 2025
- George gave me two ways of further implementation: either polishing the code out and writing the driver itself or writing the interrupt-driven version of USART
- Started to polish the code, I was thinking a lot about how to connect USART and Flexcomm so that USART owns it
- Came up with a very simple idea: just own the pins like `embassy` does so that it is prohibited to use the same Flexcomm twice.

## 30 July 2025
- Started to write the driver outline from scratch once again
- I started with `impl_instance!()` to ensure that every USART has appropriate registers and can be configured,but it was a bit hard to work with `macro_rules`, but George helped me
- Wrote some constructors and main functions for USART TX and USART RX

## 31 July 2025
- I tried to write the code so that USART struct is as generic as possible
- However, because of Rust safety rules, it cannot deduce the used PAC type in USART struct making using of registers there impossible
- That's why I moved all the logic into the generic `Instance` (I feel like when I make a PR, I'll have many comments, though)
- Almost finished the implementation of blocking USART (hopefully)

## 1 August 2025
- Finished blocking USART implementation, introduced `usart_blocking.rs` as an example
- Talked with George about further implementation of asynchronous mode with interrupts
- Started my second [pull request](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/pull/4497)
- I spent much time to implement it, but there are still a lot of things to do. However, I like it :)

## 4 August 2025
- Had 24 comments from George and around 7 comments from the American
- Resolved all their observations
- Learnt what is `critical_section`
- A strange bug happened to me yesterday: while working on the improvements, Denis asked me to help him with blocked device. I ran `cargo run` with blinky example, then used LinkFlasher, restarted my PC, and all the contents of a folder where `embassy` fork was disappeared. Unfortunately, I didn't save my code, so I wrote what I remembered once again.
> Do more backups.
- Helped Irina with synchronizing her fork with the upstream and learnt how to do it using `git` in terminal

## 5 August 2025
- Started to explore interrupts and the logic behind them in USART
- Started to read about DMA, but George advised starting with usage of interrupts 
- Spent a lot of time to understand how to harness the interrupts 


## 6 August 2025
- Continued to 'fight' interrupts, they're not as intuitive as I thought, and they need to be harnessed. For some reason, they fired every time I unmasked them. I guess it's because of defmt lagging
- Fixed a bug in my PR with `set_baudrate` function, now it doesn't panic
- Learnt what is the ring buffer
- Started to read `buffered.rs` in `embassy-rp` and I'm going to use it as a skeleton for my code.

## 7 August 2025
- Went to the family doctor to get a paper for the IP Workshop

## 8 August 2025

## 9 August 2025
- Andrei Dragota and I printed a lot of posters and pasted them on the walls
- Carried some chairs, desks, other stuff at the university 

## 10 August 2025
- New posters were pasted :)
- Helped Laur with cabling and routers

## 11 August 2025
- Enroled in Autonomous cars course sponsored by NXP
- Assembled a car and made a logo for our team in Fusion
- Participated in IPSEC with the team of Owls, helped to build a bridge from noodle and tape

## 12 August 2025
- Learnt how to solder, I really loved doing this, it was like a meditation for me
- Took a look at the code for the car and started to figure it out
- Started to explain my junior colleague how processor works
